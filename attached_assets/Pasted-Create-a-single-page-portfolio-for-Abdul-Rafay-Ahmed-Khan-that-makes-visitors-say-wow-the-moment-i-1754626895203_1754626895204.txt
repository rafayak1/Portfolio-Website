Create a single-page portfolio for Abdul Rafay Ahmed Khan that makes visitors say “wow” the moment it loads.
	1.	Opening gateway (dual persona)
• The first thing people see is a dramatic 3-D stage holding two animated avatarcenterbdul Rafay.
• Avatar one, labeled “Software Engineer”, is shown typing in mid-air while shimmering lines of code swirl around him.
• Avatar two, labeled “Data Engineer”, is shown guiding floating cubes of data that stream into glowing charts.
• Avatars gently pulse, enlarge when hovered, and when clicked the camera dives forward with a burst of particles and reveals the matching persona section.
	2.	Common layout inside each persona
• A “Back to personas” button floats quietly in a corner throughout the journey.
• Sections appear one after another with smooth scroll-snap and subtle parallax stars in the background:
– About Me vignette (short text beside a miniature 3-D work scene)
– Tech Stack showcase (logos gliding or orbiting in motion)
– Experience timeline (cards that pop forward as you scroll)
– Projects wall (tilting cards that show GIF previews on hover)
– Contact drawer (slides out when the visitor clicks a glowing icon)

• Community note: Same leadership credentials, emphasizing national ML-oriented coding competitions.
• Contact drawer: identical links and style as the Software-Engineer track.
	5.	Motion & delight
• Section titles ripple softly into place.
• Tech-stack logos periodically burst into particles then reform.
• Key numbers (like “9 % recall uplift” or “10 000+ queries/day”) count up when they scroll into view.
• The projects wall feels like a sleek gallery; cards float slightly and rearrange smoothly on smaller screens.
• When the contact drawer opens, it leaves a short comet tail and closes with a gentle bounce.
	6.	Mobile and accessibility
• Provide simplified, high-quality static images if a device can’t run heavy motion smoothly.
• Every feature is keyboard-friendly, color-contrast compliant, and has meaningful alt text.
	7.	Overall tone
• Bold futuristic visuals, clear and concise copy, plenty of breathing room so the animations and numbers take center stage.
